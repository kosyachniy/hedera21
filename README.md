Hello there! For this submission we built a Hedera metamask browser extension and a web-application for smart tickets. To try it yourself, please follow the next steps:

1) Check https://ecogeneration.online/ . The button shouldn't be active because of absence of metamask.
2) Download HederaMask extension from google drive https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vZctyk1bm2bdKqxxxfqjmQIaM3LNyt-j/view?usp=sharing 
3) Open Chrome (if not open)
4) Go to chrome://extensions
5) Turn on the developer mode (top right corner)
6) Press "Load unpacked" and choose the downloaded extenstion
7) Turn the extension on and pin it to the top bar. Then you can refresh https://ecogeneration.online/ and go through the organiser's interface and then through the visitor's interface after following the link (which will be generated after issuing tickets)
